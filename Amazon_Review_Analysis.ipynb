    "\n",
    "The dataset in focus contains customer reviews of a product. Each row in the dataset represents a unique review, with the following information provided:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Product Rating\n",
    "- Date of the Review\n",
    "- Product Variation\n",
    "- The Content of the Review (verified_reviews)\n",
    "- A binary indicator for overall feedback (1 for positive, 0 for negative)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques used in our analysis are Sentiment Analysis, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Word Frequency Analysis. The primary focus of the analysis is on the `verified_reviews` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of the sentiment analysis is to understand whether the sentiment within the reviews aligns with the provided ratings and feedback. By using the TextBlob library, we calculated the polarity scores, which range from -1 (most negative sentiment) to 1 (most positive sentiment), and subjectivity scores, ranging from 0 (most objective) to 1 (most subjective). This examination aimed to validate if sentiments inferred from the review texts are in accordance with the provided ratings and feedback scores.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Named Entity Recognition (NER)\n",
    "\n",
    "The SpaCy library's Named Entity Recognition module was utilized to identify specific entities mentioned in the reviews. This process helped in uncovering proper nouns or technical terms that customers frequently mention in their reviews, which could shed light on key features or issues of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Word Frequency Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "To identify the most common words or phrases in the reviews, a word frequency analysis was carried out using the NLTK library. This involved the removal of stopwords to ensure the focus was on meaningful words. This analysis served to highlight commonly used terms, which could indicate popular features or recurrent complaints among customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendations for Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Going forward, it would be beneficial to explore advanced NLP techniques such as Topic Modeling to uncover the main themes in the reviews. Furthermore, machine learning models could be employed to predict review ratings based on the review text. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind, the effectiveness of these analyses greatly depends on thorough data preprocessing, which includes handling case sensitivity, removing punctuation, and performing stemming or lemmatization.\n",
